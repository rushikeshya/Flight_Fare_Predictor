# Flight Fare Prediction

This is a project for predicting flight fares using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface for users to input their travel details and get predictions on the flight fares.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the fare of flights based on various parameters such as departure date, arrival date, source, destination, number of stops, and airline. The model is trained on historical flight data to learn patterns and relationships between these features and the flight fares.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- HTML/CSS
